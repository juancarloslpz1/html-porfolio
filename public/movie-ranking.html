<h3>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</h3>
<p>This movies is hilarious, and it great to just watch when you don't want to think about anything.</p> 

<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>What else can I say? "I got the need... the need for speed!"</p>

<h3>Blow</h3>
<p>A look at the 80's drug movement for a Bostonian who worked with the infomous Pablo Escobar. Crazy flick, based on a true story.</p>
