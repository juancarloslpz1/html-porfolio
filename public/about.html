<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>  I am originally from El Paso,TX. I am the youngest of 5 siblings, and am also the only one of the siblings that DOESN"T have kids.
  The second youngest is six years older than me. He's the only other male in our family.
  I am an uncle and even a great uncle. I have way too many nieces and nephew to count. (A LOT!). 
  I moved to Denver,CO as soon as I got out of high school. <br/>

  When I was 22 I enlosted in the U.S. Army, where after basic training and advance individualized training, I worked on the Apache helicopter.
  If I have known then what I know now, I would have choosen a different path. Alas, I'm not sure I know what I would have chosen. 
  The Army was great until it wasn't. I wanted more.<br/>

  When I got out in 2006 (Honorably Discharged), I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I looked into different avenues, had some restaurant, labor intensive,
  and some pretty boring jobs. I stumbbled upon the IT world and started working as a computer technnician, refurbishing computer for a second hand market.
  That gig did not last, and soon I was back to square one. I kept pushing and found other jobs in the industry. I did everything from helpdesk (not fun at all)
  to working in data centers. <br/>

  Wasted time in contract work. The one gig I actually liked (and lasted the longest) finally hired me on as an FTE (Full-time employee), but it didn't last long.
  The company laid-off like fifteen-hundred, two-thousand people in June of 2020 (Covid).<br/> 

  As I wondered what I was going to do, I looked into web development, but only looked. It would be a few years before I started learning it. Hopefully, this wil be
  my career going forward. Here's to hope!<br/>
