<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>  I am originally from El Paso,TX. I am the youngest of five siblings, and am also the only one of the siblings that DOESN'T have kids.
  The second youngest is six years older than me. He's the only other male in our family.I am an uncle and even a great uncle. I have way too 
  many nieces and nephews to count. (A LOT!). I moved to Denver,CO as soon as I got out of high school 1996. My parents were born and raised
  in Mexico. The settled in El Paso in the 1960's.</p>

  <p>When I was 22 I enlisted in the U.S. Army, where after basic training and advance individualized training, I worked on the Apache helicopter.
  If I have known then what I know now, I would have choosen a different path. Alas, I'm not sure I know what I would have chosen. 
  The Army was great until it wasn't. I wanted more.</p>

 <p> When I got out in 2006 (Honorably Discharged), I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I looked into different avenues, and had some restaurant, labor intensive,
  and some pretty boring jobs. I stumbbled upon the IT world and started working as a computer technnician, refurbishing computer for a second hand market.
  That gig did not last, and soon I was back to square one. I kept pushing and found other jobs in the industry. I did everything from helpdesk (not fun at all)
  to working in data centers. I still want more.</p> 

  <p>As I wonder what I wanted to do after mostly contract work in the operation side of IT, I looked into web development, but only looked. It would be a few years 
  before I started learning it. Hopefully, this wil be my career going forward. Here's to hope!</p>
