<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello all! My name is Juan Carlos Lopez, and I live in Denver Colorado. Computers have always facinated me, 
  and I have been working in Desktop Support for about 12 of my 14 years in IT. I have also worked as a Service
  Desk Analyst, and a Data Center Engineer (really cool gig)! 
</p>

<p>Lately I have felt the urge for a new challenge. To reach my goal of being able to work from anywhere in the world
  I please. As I have researched different position, two keep coming back. One being DevOps, the othr being Devolpment.
  They both sound interesting to me, but Coding feels like it might be more freeing. More inline with my goals
</p>

<p>I don't know how long this journey is going to take to, or if I will even start a career as a front-end, back-end,
  or full-stack developer. However, learning this skill can only benefit me in the end. Here's to many lessons learned.
  Some head-aches that don't involve alcohol, and hopefully it's all capped with an awesome career! Cheers y'all!
